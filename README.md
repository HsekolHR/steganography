# steganography

This is the process for hiding data into a image. The code is simply hardcoded the data which you want to hide.

You just get any image from web/system and have it. Copy th path of the image and put it the path 'image.png'. 

Installation Required:

      pip install stegano
      
The stegno contains two methods hide() and reveal(). This makes sense for this code.
